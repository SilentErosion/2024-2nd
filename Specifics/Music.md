## I want to
- Rearrange songs and play songs that I hear
- Experiment with music = Hands on learning in music theory and composing

## So for that, I need to
- Be familiar with the existing patterns, and why they sound good: Ear training, and sheet music reading
- Get used to playing the piano to the level at which I can play what I think without much difficulty

## So my intermediate goals are
1. Make a sheet music for a band: 생존약속, 소로, Care
2. Play 5 new age, 3 classical, 10 accompaniment for pop songs without critical errors (+ doing some arrangement). Record the performances to prove.
3. Make less errors in melodic dications
4. Learn the popular patterns of guitar, piano, bass, strings(violin, cello, etc): Musical dictation of cover songs, instrumental music, etc

## So to learn, my goals for now are
1. Sign up for a piano institute to get some help in practice: Ask for advice about what to learn if I only have three months and want to do the above
2. Memorize 5 new age or inst sheet music in terms of pattern: 3 piano, 1 guitar, 1 bass
3. Practice melodic dictation constantly: Try not to make as few errors as possible (on the sub)
4. Make 30 musical phrases from melodic dictations I've done, and think about variations

## Some Possible ways to Learn
- Composing/Rearranging on my own no matter how bad they are
- Analyze sheet music to find a pattern in accompaniment, arpegio, chord progressions, and melodic lines
- Ear trainings like musical dictation
