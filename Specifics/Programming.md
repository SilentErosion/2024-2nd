# Learning
## JWP: Learn how to simply implement and improve an back-end application
- Just do as what the book wants me to. Make sure not to cheat. Always solve problems on my own before looking at the solution.
- If it's not hands-on practice, make sure to remember all.

## Rust 100 Exercises: Try to be thorough and well-reasoned when solving problems
- First, complete the whole exercises. Focus on defining problems and retrieving what I read.
- When done, make a systematic knowledge structure focusing on key concepts out of what I've learned so far
- Convert it into images and memorize using mnemonics
- Do the exercises from the beginning with images, and improve them

# Personal Projects
### Android Application for Meal QR
- Problem and Goal: I have to login every time to get QR for meal, which is disturbing because I have to scroll down to hit the login button. So I want to make an application to get a QR at home screen with one touch.
### Android Application for Meal Reservation Status
- Problem and Goal: I don't want to write on calendar or check the website just to know the current status. I want a calendar widget that shows the reservation status of the entire month.
### Automatic Meal Reservation
- Problem and Goal: I often forget to reserve meals. I want RPA for meal reservations.


# School
## System Programming Assignments: Practice good coding habits
- TDD-like programming: Unit tests, test cases, concrete specification
- Design then program: Think abstractly first, then design algorithm, data structure, functions accrodingly
- Clean code: Naming rules, readability, etc
