## Goals
- To build my own visual knowledge structure
- To improve my short-term visual memory  

## Basic Principles

- Quantity over quality
- Develop mental strategies along the way
- Try generalizing the results of observations

## Some Possible Ways to Learn
- Themed researches: How plants are different, visual patterns in street lights, animal anatomy, etc
- Simple observing and drawing (Visual Intelligence / Vinci's blog)
  - Real life

## What I Am Going to Do for Now
Still need to make them more specific.
1. Themed research on things at where I go
   - Start with brainstorming the objects
3. "The" training
4. Observe people on the subway
