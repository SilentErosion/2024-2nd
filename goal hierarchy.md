Question what I wonder very specifically  
Learn what I *need*   
Remember what I learned  

1. Be a good programmer
    1. Get a lot of hands-on experiences in various fields of IT(e.g. Android apps, web front/back, Linux). And Be proficient in at least one field.
    2. Get an internship position in web development that starts next year. Probably in January or March. Alternatively, apply for free courses about web or android development that provides a lot of feedback and project experiences.
    3. Be active in learning CS by top-down approach

1. Be an artist - music, painting, poems, etc
    1. Musician: Composing, Rearranging, Performing
       - ~~Make sheet music of my favorite songs to train my ear~~ (on hold till I get good enough)
       - Download some piano new age sheet music, make them on my own and compare with them.
       - Get used to playing the piano enough to focus on musical experiments rather than skills
    2. Painter: Pencil, Watercolor/Oil/Colored pencil, Calligraphy, Designer
       - Drawing: Just do it and make a lot of mistakes. Then figure out what went wrong and fix them.
       - Calligraphy: Maybe take some basic lessons
       - Design: Need to be able to remember and recall visually first
    3. Poet: Rhyme, Metaphor, Association
       - Just write a simple essay every day considering those three things until I come up with particular goals.

1. Be a visual thinker: This has nothing to do with aesthetics
    1. Be observant and enhance my short-term visual memory
    2. Get proficient in drawing what I see so that I don't have to train it anymore
    3. Analyze everyday objects

1. Learn science and math that are related to daily life products
    1. Do the project I planned before
