# 2nd Round(9.19-9.30)
<!--I don't think I am ready to apply for the jobs. Especially, in terms of what only I can do. But I could write cover letters and get feedback or give feedback on my own. Experience is the most important anyway.  
I've heard from one HR person and one PM that big companies want applicants with one specialty and overall ability to learn new things. But startups and IT companies want proficiency in specific skills(e.g. frameworks(React, Spring, ...), cloud structure, docker/kubernetes) and vast knowledge about the infrastructure. So to get into IT companies, more experience like internship seems necessary. -->

# 1st Round(9.10-9.18)
I can't properly control my time and environments due to the long holidays. So I am not going to do the things that require constant reviews and no distractions.
1. Complete Rust 100 Exercises:  
   - At first, just try to solve problems on my own, referring to the materials.
   - Next make systematic, intuitive images to think with.
   - Then do it over to develop the images. Make review problems or sessions and add them in Anki.

3. Try to Make Core Habits
   1. Active observing and listening = No zoning out and mindless repetition: For now, focus on short-term memory capability.  
      - When I have to just sit there, observe what are before me and try to recall them with my eyes closed. Repeat till I can.  
      - When listening, make what I hear into mental images and try to hold them in my mind.
   2. Plan-Do-Feedback cycle: With Rust exercises.
4. Read 《The Organized Mind》 in A Top-Down Way:
